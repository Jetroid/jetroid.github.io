A number of times over the past year, I have received emails, comments, or seen blog posts that praise me for my work. When I dig deeper, it usually turns out that they know me for one specific project.

It's nice to receive the praise - very nice! - but it makes you feel a bit unappreciated for your other works. I long to be complimented about some minor project that I have all but forgotten about, or something like that. I'm more than just the one work!

I'd previously heard that [some musicians don't like playing their most famous songs](https://www.grunge.com/129075/musicians-who-hate-their-most-famous-songs/). Being complimented on just the one project makes me sympathise with how an musician or artist may feel when they are known for a specific few hits or pieces.

I realise that I'm being completely ungrateful here, and that I should feel good about the fact that my works are appreciated at all, but I can't help how I feel.

I actually like the piece of work that I get complimented on, unlike some of those musicians (and other artists in the same boat), so I guess there's that. My instinct is to 'double-down' on my successes, but that isn't really possible here (or at least, there's no real benefit to doing so).

I should probably just keep working on my other things to try to get recognised for those too. :)
