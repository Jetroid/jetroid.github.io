If you're anything like me, you sometimes put something off that is crucially important.

If I encounter something I'm not sure about how to do, I might put it off for a while. Then I keep putting it off, until it gets to the point where I'm thinking about doing it every day, but not actually doing it. It becomes this big thing in my mind that stresses me out greatly.

But still I don't do it, and I get more and more worked up and stressed.

When I finally do it, it really feels like a great weight has lifted from your shoulders.

I don't know why I'm like that. I'm trying to get better about it.
