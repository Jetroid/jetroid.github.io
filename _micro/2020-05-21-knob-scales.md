Short article today, just because I want to post about something I found useful.

[This plugin](https://github.com/leechwort/knob-scale-generator) lets you generate knob scales easily in Inkscape.

It's easily to use; after installing the extension, simply go to Extension -> Render -> Knob Scale...

From there, you can generate your scale, and export the rendered image for your own purposes.

It wasn't working for Inkscape 1.0, so I ported it from 0.92. I'm also working on changes that allow you to use fractional numbers, as that was a restriction for my purposes.
