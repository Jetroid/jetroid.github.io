I often feel nostalgic for something I've never actually experienced.

Like travelling [through traditional asia](https://www.perceptivetravel.com/issues/1218/kelly.html), without any information about where to go or what to do, surviving on very little in meagre conditions. I miss having to ask people you meet for information, where travellers would seek each other out to learn from each other. I miss being cut off from the rest of the world, not knowing what to expect from the next city.

Or later, travelling during the early ages of the internet, getting a few [scraps of internet from online](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18642755) and going to a flickery CRT monitor in an internet cafe to get in touch with friends back home.

I miss the idea of internet cafes in general. I miss sitting in a grubby cubical [surrounded by eccentric strangers and friendly staff](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2019/05/12/voices/memoirs-japanese-internet-cafe/). I miss using the outdated software, and realising that [my website is broken](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/10/23/the-ie-css-bug-which-cost-me-a-months-salary/), and hastily trying to fix it with the completely wrong set of equipment an programs.

Internet Cafes were only in our world for the briefest of times; from somewhere between the internet and computing becoming a widespread need, but before internet and computers in the home were a standard. They have since been thoroughly killed by the modern laptop, smart phone, and wireless data connections. I never used one, so why do I miss it so much?

What about the early days of [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) (and BBS systems before them), when students on university campuses would connect up their computers to talk to each other, originating many forms of jargon, proto-web communication, and even technology concepts that still live on today.

Or just a more nebulous concept in general, like sharing a room with a few friends and a fridge filled only with beers and soft drinks, [working away simultaneously collaboratively and alone on a meaningless project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnNLAg8_YNI). All whilst having the '[Hacker Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_Manifesto)' displayed proudly as a poster on your wall.

I miss a time when [everyone wore rollerskates to clubs and played video games whilst listening to techno](https://youtu.be/ATlszssL-eI?t=7). Okay, I'm not sure this one ever actually happened, but I still feel nostalgic about it sometimes.

I long to hang out at the [C-Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-base) in Berlin.

Most of these 'nostalgia subjects' are very rough (or slightly seedy) and usually decidedly nerdy. I'm sure that in times to come, I will reflect on the current era with a deserved sense of nostalgia, as I already do for some earlier periods of my life.
