Douglas Adams famously wrote his final book - *Mostly Harmless* - whilst going through a host of personal issues that lead to an unpleasant year.

The book suffered for it, ending with most of the main characters dead, every human killed, and the Earth destroyed.

What would *Mostly Harmless* have been like if Douglas Adams' year had been a wonderful one?

I bring this up because I briefly re-read my microblogs from January and was shocked by how negative they seemed.

I was in a very negative mindset, and it shows. I felt like my life sucked, was considering breaking up with my girlfriend (we didn't, and things are much better now), had been continuously ill for weeks, and was struggling with the project I was working on.

I was complaining a lot, or writing about the bad things that had happened to me, or just talking about the few boring things I did.

Few of the posts from that time are worth reading, so I won't be publishing all of them. Of those that are at least half way interesting, I will edit and produce proper backdated blog posts with their content at some point.

It's a good idea to be conscious about how our mood and mindset is affecting our output, especially during our current shared Coronavirus experience!
