We all have regrets in life.

"I wish I hadn't said that to him."

"I could have studied harder in college."

"I should have experimented more when I was younger."

"I ought to have been more careful when I signed off on that."

Consider these feelings.

Some of them will help you to make sense of the world, avoid negative behaviours in the future, or make more positive choices. If so, they were useful; take their lesson to heart and stop dwelling on them.

Other times, regrets simply hinder us. Regrets can become self-blame and fruitless introspection. They cause us to avoid taking risks. We hesitate because we'd prefer to avoid making the same bad decisions that we made in the past.

By dwelling on our mistakes, we're raising our stress levels and making ourselves less likely to take a chance in the future.

Forgive yourself, and move forward. You might end up regretting it if you don't.
