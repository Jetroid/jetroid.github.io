This post marks a full month of these micro blogs.

In total, I've written somewhere in the ballpark of 13000 words.

I posted a few of the posts a day late, and missed one day (the 27th).

I tend to prioritise other things for most of the day, so leave writing until very late, which has affected my sleep schedule somewhat. I'm finishing writing this at 4AM, oops.

#### Initial Difficulties

At first I found it difficult to think of something to write about every day. I often think about things during my off hours in the day, but by the time I sit down to write I forgot what I was thinking about.

I've resolved this by jotting down notes about things that I might like to write about. Seems to be working so far, but if I don't get to something in time it might lose it's relevance.

#### Reflections On Past Works

The biggest thing that this month of writing has taught me is that there isn't a whole lot of difference in quality between these quick microposts and the much longer posts that I would typically write. The hours I'd spend agonising over the traditional articles didn't particularly improve quality, and actually made them feel a bit artificial, as I cut out 'my own voice' and my own writing style.

It took me a really long time to write some of my [travel](/travel/) posts. I'd spend days writing just one article. I'm not joking. Then I'd get really burned out because all I was doing for days in a row was writing, and I'd get agitated that I wasn't doing something to progress my career. I probably wasted my first few weeks in Chiang Mai just writing or feeling burned out about writing.

I think the microblog could be a good format for travel articles; short excerpts about a new place or when something interesting happens. I can kick out a microblog in half an hour to an hour, so I don't start feeling burned out and they don't really use up my day.

That's the nice thing about writing consistently; you're not doing one big chunk. Just a little, every day.

#### Reflections On Other Daily Creators

I have a new-found respect for people that create every day.

Especially if they manage to make every article concise and thought provoking like [Seth](https://seths.blog/) does, or if they can make their work gorgeous like [beeple](https://twitter.com/beeple) does.

It felt really good for me to put something out there every day, as it truly meant that no day would be a zero day. Didn't have a very productive day working? No problem, you're shipping a micro blog later.

But there was also days when it was very hard for me to write something worth reading. In fact, I downright failed a few days, and published just to publish. So I respect those content creators that create value every day.

#### Reflections On The Process

I've also realised that I have to think about my own thoughts a lot more too. Whilst writing something like [Falling Into Place](/micro/falling-into-place/) or [Identity](/micro/identity/), I had to question myself about *why* I was thinking what I was thinking, so that I could better articulate it to a reader.

I've always heard that teaching is the best way of learning. Perhaps writing is the best way of thinking?
