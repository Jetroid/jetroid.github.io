As you may or may not know, this website was [one of my first forays into web development](https://jetholt.com/designed-and-refined/). Although I have incrementally improved the design here and there, it has remained relatively unchanged since then.

I was very fond of it when I first developed it in 2016, and I got almost universal support and praise from my close friends and family that I showed it to.

Since then, I've grown somewhat tired of the design. The overuse of images feels somewhat amaturish and a little distracting. The grey colour I chose for the overlays and backgrounds looks too brown for my tastes (I'd prefer it to be more blue...) and I've never been particularly happy with the font, either.

The design of these micro post pages is a little better because it does away with the persistent background image, but I feel like there's a happy medium to be found.

The only things I wouldn't change are the broad strokes of the homepage design, the red and white text colours, and my site logo.

I feel like I *could* make something **much** prettier, but I consider it to be a mammoth task without any real payoff. Especially since I don't particularly like working with HTML + CSS.

Changing the design of this website does not 'move the needle'; it'd purely be for vanity. There are better things to focus on. [Perfection kills](/micro/perfection-kills).

So this website will remain in this state, and I will continually be unhappy with it. At least, until I eventually get sick enough to change it, or have no higher priority issues.
