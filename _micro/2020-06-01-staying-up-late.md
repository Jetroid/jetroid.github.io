I often end up in a weird sleep cycle where I sleep at a very late time and wake up during the late morning or even during the afternoon.

This usually isn't because I "work better at night" - I actually feel like I probably work worse at night. Or rather, if it's too late in the night, I subconsciously slack off more or can't focus as well.

And it isn't because I "prefer to be awake at night". I do - it's cooler and quieter - but that's not the reason.

No, it's because **I keep trying to push to achieve more in a day**.

Let's say I'm sleeping at a 'normal' sleep schedule - waking up early, sleeping before midnight, whatever. If I'm not happy with what I achieved during the day, I try to squeeze in *a little bit more* by staying up late.

This has a knock-on effect of making me wake up later (assuming that I don't have a commitment to attend to).

Repeat this enough times, and suddenly *I'm waking up during the middle of the day*, and heading to sleep at around the same time that the sun is beginning to rise!

I end up having to do a 'correction day' where I stay awake for longer and sleep at a 'normal' time.

I don't think that this is necessarily healthy. I think that I need to learn to "let it go" and just achieve more the next day; I'll probably be more refreshed and eager to work.

The main reason that I don't do that is because I'm in a "flow state" during the nights when I choose to push the sleep schedule, which I wouldn't necessarily be in during the morning.

So I'd guess that it's easier for someone on a "[Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)" to maintain a regular sleep schedule than someone on a "Maker's Schedule"; the maker has a real need for a 'flow state'.

Maybe I should try it the other way. If I want to "push" to achieve a little more, I should note what I need to do, go directly to sleep, but set my alarm for an hour early to get it done?

Food for thought.
