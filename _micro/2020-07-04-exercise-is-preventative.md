[Julian Martinez](https://twitter.com/julianeon) over on Twitter made a really accurate tweet that I couldn't help but agree with:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What I&#39;ve noticed for myself is: <br><br>If I wait until I&#39;m feeling bad it&#39;s too late.<br><br>The running/lifting weights is preventative. I don&#39;t notice it in the moment making me feel better, but if I do them regularly that results.<br><br>Mentally knowing that keeps me doing them, and going.</p>&mdash; Julian Martinez (@julianeon) <a href="https://twitter.com/julianeon/status/1279496626613006336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote>

And he's completely right! I also find that it's a lot easier to stave off the 'bad times' by focussing on working out. Whenever I notice those feelings start to approach, if I focus on running or working out, it'll go away. I don't really tend to get those feelings when I'm heavily into working out, too.

But I think the concept goes further than that; if you have a workout routine, you're also preventing a lot of physical health issues, too. It's easier to not put weight on in the first place, than to have to try to lose it, for example.
