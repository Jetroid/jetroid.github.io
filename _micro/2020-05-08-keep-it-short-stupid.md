In programming, there is a maxim called 'KISS' - Keep It Simple, Stupid.

The idea is, even though it's possible to create more efficient code by optimisation or whatever, often the best way is the keep it simple so that it's easiest to understand and debug.

It often doesn't matter about the efficiency gains that you want to create. Keep it simple, because you might need to change it in the future. Keep it simple so that you can come back to it in five years and still understand what is going on.

Well, I need to remind myself to follow a maxim when writing these micro posts - Keep It Short, Stupid.

I have been writing too much for these microposts, which completely defeats the point. I'm back to spending days writing a single article, something that I explicitly wanted to avoid.

I've tried to write today's article three times now, and each time I sit down to write, I realise that the topic I wanted to write about requires me to explain another topic first, and then before I know it I've written a manuscript.

Well, at least now I have some drafts for future days!
