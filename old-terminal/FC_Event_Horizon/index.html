Event Horizon - Programmable Hybrid Analogue/Digital Sequencer<p> 
    &nbsp;The story behind how the Polygraf came about is, at least to me, quite a humorous one. Looking at some of the modules in the Frequency Central Musical Laboratories for inspiration to build a project for fun and experience, I decided to attempt to replicate my interpretation of what a module *might* do, without ever touching it, analysing what it does, or even looking at the front panel too hard. <p>

  &nbsp;To put it simply: As I know nothing about musical tech, the module I looked at did not do at all what I thought it did; the module in question was a sequencer running a pre-defined sequence and you could use switches to determine whether a particular output was on or off for the entire sequence. <p>

  &nbsp;Event Horizon's first prototype took the name 'Grid Machine', and it was much like a Drum Machine in that you can program in 8 output, 16 stage sequences, which the module will remember. The Grid Machine was able to support 15 user defined sequences plus one hard-coded-by-Frequency-Central that the user cannot change. The problem came in that the interface was not intuitive. Frequency Central commented that I had designed a device that only I knew how to use.<p>

  &nbsp;Spring 2015 brought many changes. It was outfitted with two seven segment displays to make the interface much more useable, and the entire purpose of the module was changed from creating drum sounds to creating sequences of oscillations. <p>
