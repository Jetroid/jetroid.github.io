Grid Machine - Binary Drum Machine<p> 
    &nbsp;The story behind how Codename Grid Machine (Name TBC) came about is, at least to me, quite a humorous one. Looking at some of the modules in the Frequency Central Musical Laboratories for inspiration to build a project for fun and experience, I decided to attempt to replicate my interpretation of what a module *might* do, without ever touching it, analysing what it does, or even looking at the front panel too hard. <p>
  &nbsp;To put it simply: As I know nothing about musical tech, the module did not do at all what I thought it did; the module in question was a sequencer running a pre-defined sequence and you could use switches to determine whether a particular output was on or off for the entire sequence. <p>
  &nbsp;Codename Grid Machine is like a Drum Machine (which I had never heard of at the time) in that you can program in a specific 8 output, 16 stage sequence, which the module will remember (permanently, until you rewrite it.). The Grid Machine is able to support 15 user defined sequences plus one hard-coded-by-Frequency-Central that the user cannot change.<p>
  &nbsp;I had to create an interface using only LEDs to represent the state of the program that I would want a user to understand intuitively. I had wanted to use binary to represent numbers to the user, but Frequency Central advised that they wouldn't have understood this intuitively. Instead, as I envision the outputs would be in the format of two rows of four LEDs. To display a sequences as being in 4 banks of 4 sequences. Ie: The top row of LEDs represents which bank the sequence is in, and the second row of LEDs represents the individual sequence in a bank.<p>
