  <p>Kids, Jet has an announcement. <br />
 This week, Jet finished all of school! <br />
 He worked so hard they gave him a prize - a certificate! <br />
 And it’s called a… <br />
– <cite><a href="https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/ac1n16">Age Chapman</a>, describing my graduation to her children.</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>June 28th was results day this year at my University. This year was the final year of my <a href="https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/programmes/g401-meng-computer-science-4-yrs">MEng Computer Science</a> degree so I’d be finding out what grade I received.</p>

<p>Two months back, I got the result for my Group Design project, and calculated that I needed an overall average grade of 78% for my remaining modules (Cryptography, Semantic Web, and Automated Code Generation). 78% seemed an insurmountable task given the breadth and difficulty of some of the content in the Cryptography module, the lack of interest I found I had for the Semantic Web module, and the fact that my average mark for most modules (the ones that I did whilst not depressed) was around 75%. The only consolation was that I found the Automated Code Generation module incredibly engaging, felt that it was taught really well, and really wanted to learn more. Thanks, Julian!</p>

<p>Given that I had an <a href="/the-grip-of-depression/">awful third year of University</a> in so many different ways, I had known for the whole year that it would be hard for me to get a First. If I had chosen to skip the Master’s degree and graduate with a bachelors last year, I would have gotten a Lower Second Class Honours. Trying to increase by two grade categories with one year (worth 40% of the overall grade) required strong results this year to offset things - I tried all year to give it my best but I didn’t fully believe I capable of it (even though I believed I would have found getting First Class Honours relatively easy if I had enjoyed a better third year of study).</p>

<p>After I completed my exams, I felt that whilst Cryptography’s exam went less well than ideal, the Semantic Web and Automated Code Generation exams went very well, and that if I had gotten the questions correct that I felt were truly correct, then I would graduate with a First Class Honours - just. I thought I’d be painfully borderline and get there on a technicality - if you achieve 69.5% overall across your degree, they round your score up to 70%. It wouldn’t be the first time something like that had happened to me - in A Level Mathematics, you need 90% across the Core 3 and Core 4 exams to achieve an A*. I got 80% in one exam and 100% in the other, leaving me dead on the mark with 90%.</p>

<p>The actual results day crept up on me; I had been focussing on packing or disposing of my things in preparation to move out, as well as cleaning the house so that we get back our £500 deposit, and working as a research assistant. This left little time for thinking about student things, and as such, I had forgotten about it almost completely until Daniel reminded me the day before.</p>

<p>In anticipation of results day, to celebrate having completed our degree, and as a final Hurrah before we left Southampton, Daniel and I chose to go to the Thaikhun Thai Street Food restaurant in Southampton the day before. Daniel intends to <a href="https://daniellockyer.com/the-next-two-months/">start his nomad adventure in Thailand</a>, so it was encouraging for both of us how tasty the food was.</p>

<em>Images provides by <a href="https://daniellockyer.com">Daniel</a></em></p>

<p>On the eve of results, I dreamed two different dreams whilst I slept. I dreamed that I completely failed to get any grade at all (essentially an impossibility), but that I took the failure in my stride and become a successful musician - a weird thing to dream considering I can’t currently play any instruments! My second dream was that I passed with flying colours, and then not much happened - I just bought Indian food as I would to celebrate many other events.</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the outcome didn’t truly matter to me or my future career trajectory - hopefully I’ll never be in a position where having a degree or not matters, and even then, if somebody is considering my degree as an only factor of whether they want to work with me (and not what I can do, my work ethic, etc), then frankly I don’t want to work with them. Even so, as the hours ticked closer to the 2PM when results were released, I got more and more nervous. Whilst I would be somewhat happy to get a first, I knew that I would be much more disappointed with a Upper Second Class degree. I know I can achieve more, and the classification also doesn’t particularly say much about a student as 50% of all students in the UK are awarded that classification.</p>

<p>2PM passed without receiving an email. A month ago, we had also been expecting the feedback from a coursework assignment which never came. Daniel and I joked that the results email was delayed because of the assignment, which helped relieve some of the painful tension. We also continued our running joke of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/stress 10</code>, mimicking the Mindful Makers bot format.</p>

<p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/content/aos-stress.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After much refreshing of my email client, at 2:29PM, Dan received his email and started getting excited about his module marks - for him, the First Class Honours degree classification was an almost foregone conclusion, so I can understand why he’d be particularly excited about a high module mark. Still, it didn’t help my anxiety!</p>

<p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/content/aos-anticipation.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Two minutes later, I received my email, and my hands were shaking so much I struggled to click the email.</p>

<p>The email starts off with your module marks - wow, everything looks goooooooood!</p>

<p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/content/aos-marks.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>…and then has this beautiful piece of text:</p>

<p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/content/aos-thebigone.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Wow! OMG! I did it!</p>

<p>And not only that, but I did it legit without using the 69.5% rounding loophole. 70.305%! Almost a whole percent above the cutoff! I also did better in every summer exam than I had predicted.</p>

<p>Dan was incredibly excited for me! Perhaps more than I was - I was still in shock, I think.</p>

<p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/content/aos-excitement.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I also naturally told my family. My Mom and I had a very sweet phone call. My sister cried because my achievement made her really happy; she also posted emotional messages about it to her Facebook followers.</p>

<p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/content/aos-sister.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My Father had some choice words:</p>

<p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/content/aos-father.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dan and I also posted to <a href="https://mindfulmakers.club/">M2</a>, and we received lots of love from that great, supportive community.</p>

<p>I also told Age and George, the Doctors that I am working with to produce a research paper, and they were very excited for me too! A few days later, Age even told her kids about it over dinner, much to my embarrassment. The kids were too young to really understand what it meant, and I am always embarrassed to have other people talk about my achievements, so it was a little awkward all around.</p>

<p>I’d already decided a few months ago that I didn’t want to attend the graduation ceremony - It seemed expensive and I suspected it would be a lot of boring posing, too long watching people I didn’t know receive their degrees, and far too much tedious, pointless ‘networking’.</p>

<p>The next day, when I arrived to the research lab, I found that the card reader was denying my student ID - oh right, I’m not a student because I technically graduated! Oops! Guess I need a new card!</p>

<p>Overall, I’m happier with a First Class Honours than I thought I would be. I feel that this classification symbolically represents the difficulty I had with depression, as well as the effort it took to overcome it and compensate for the lost marks. It was a lot of work to get to this conclusion from the ‘unwinnable’ position I found myself in at the start of the year. I know how hard some of the University Experience was for me, and this award shows that even under the most adverse circumstances, the most hopeless odds, I can overcome them and achieve what I need to.</p>

<p>I still don’t think the actual qualification means much of anything, but I’m glad that I have it. A degree doesn’t mean much in the indie/tech world - it’s more important if you have a specific set of skills and abilities, and a degree doesn’t really represent that. In tech, many of the ‘rockstar’ programmers/makers/CEOs do not have degrees, and many of those individuals who do have degrees produce bad work. Even at my University, there are a few select people that graduated with First Class Honours whom I know to be somewhat incompetent. The fact that I was able to get a First Class despite my screwed up third year also implies to me that perhaps degrees are too easy.</p>

<p>All I have to do now is collect my certificate once it has been printed.</p>

<p>And pay off the tens of thousands of debt I have accrued. But let’s not worry about that.</p>
