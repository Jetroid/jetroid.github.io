			<p>I’m going to be trying to write more to this website.</p>

<p>Usually, I try to aim for a certain standard of quality in my writing, and this can really hold me up from writing about something I want to write about.</p>

<p>Sometimes it takes a week <em><strong>or more</strong></em> just to write <em>one</em> post. Yeah, perfection is killer.</p>

<p>It gets worse when I add images, because I agonise over them.</p>

<p>So I’m going to be writing more things to a lower quality. I’m calling these ‘Micro’ posts, and you can find a full list here: <a href="/micro/">Micro</a>.</p>

<p>They will be just what I’m thinking about, or some small observations, or whatever. Generally without pictures, without proofreading, without rewording each sentence hundreds of times. Almost as if I have a typewriter and a stream of conciousness - no going back to make changes.</p>

<p>If you’re struggling to understand the difference, compare the <a href="https://cad-comic.com/">Ctrl + Alt + Del</a> webcomic with it’s “Micro” webcomic, <a href="https://cad-comic.com/category/sillies/">Sillies</a>.</p>

<p>Because these posts will (probably) be of a lower quality to what I’d usually put out, I’m categorising them differently. Only the most recent few will show on the homepage (and also won’t have images dedicated to them!).</p>

<p>At the end of each month, I’ll publish a monthly summary that has links to all of the micro posts from that month, as well some writing at the top (like you’re reading now!) that might include some reflections on the month. Or maybe I won’t write anything there at all sometimes. Who knows?</p>

<p>I won’t be sending out emails for every micro post either, though I will for the monthly summaries.</p>

<p>Micro posts and monthly summaries will not be considered as a ‘<a href="/latest/">latest</a>’ post. Instead, I have created a new url, for <a href="/latestmicro/">latest micro posts</a>. Hopefully that we be useful for people who like to bookmark things.</p>

<p>As always, everything I write (regular posts and also micro posts) will appear on the <a href="/archive/">archive</a> page. Micro posts will appear in a smaller font.</p>

						<p>I really hate running. That might surprise some people given that I do it so much, but I do. I hate it, it hurts, it’s hard work, and I don’t often feel that “Runner’s High” that people talk about. That said, I still think it’s important to run.

						<p>You can’t please everybody. That’s something I’ve come to realise, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. On some issues, both sides have completely valid concerns, and assuaging one concern fundamentally means that you can’t resolve the other. For example: Lockdowns Some people think a lockdown is the best way forward to... <a href="/micro/you-cant-please-everybody/">read more</a></p>

						<p>In programming, there is a maxim called ‘KISS’ - Keep It Simple, Stupid. The idea is, even though it’s possible to create more efficient code by optimisation or whatever, often the best way is the keep it simple so that it’s easiest to understand and debug.

						<p>I have this weird thing with domain names. Even if I don’t have a use for it right now, I’ll compulsively buy a domain name just to make sure someone else can’t take it away from me.

						<p>Two years ago, I implored my readers to ‘create their own brand and identity’ rather than choosing to wear, discuss, or identify with something just because it’s seen as ‘cool’ in our current society.
