Hey, I'm Jet.

From a young age, I've always liked making things.
As a child, I played with Lego, whilst in my early teens I made levels for video games.
My passion for making things hasn't changed - I make Software now!

I like to dream big.

I yearn to create tools and applications to help people live their lives
or to help them make decisions that are right for them. 
To me, if I am not creating something that is useful or helpful for someone,
what is the point of making it?

I'm a big believer in Sci-Fi.
So many wonders of historic Sci-Fi are realities of today.
I love the themes of Cyberpunk and megacities.
Sci-Fi inspires me. 

I believe that technology can free us 
from the manacles of the humdrum of the minutiae of life.
I believe we can all live extraordinarily.
