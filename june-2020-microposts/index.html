			<p>Today marks the second month since I started (trying to) publish a ‘micro post’ every day. You can read more about <a href="/may-2020-microblogs/">why I’m doing that by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>In short, I’m trying to publish something - anything - every day. Broadly speaking, the goal is to be more frequent with my uploads and to gradually get better at writing too. If anything, it’s just good to exercise the ‘<a href="https://twitter.com/AndreyAzimov/status/1135938608420929536">finishing muscle</a>’.</p>

<p>As promised, because this is the end of the month, I’m publishing a round-up post that includes links to all of this month’s micro posts. You can find the links below the text, as well as a small excerpt.</p>

<p>So how am I doing?</p>

<h6 id="frequency">Frequency</h6>

<p>By my count, I wrote 23 micro posts this month, which means I missed about a week’s worth of posts! That’s much worse than May, where I only missed 1 day.</p>

<p>That said, I also wrote my <a href="/climbing-the-bali-mountains/">Climbing the Bali Mountains</a> post, which took long enough to write that I didn’t feel like I needed to write a micro post on that day. The post was effectively the length of several micro posts!</p>

<p>So all told, I’m pleased with my results this month. There are a few posts which feel a bit ranty and that I’m not exactly proud of, but that probably just means I needed to get something out of my system. I’m still publishing posts that don’t necessarily meet my mark because that’s the whole point of my micro posts. Publishing helps me keep up a momentum.</p>

<p><small>Maybe publishing just to publish seems inane to you, but by <a href="/starting-many-things/">starting many things</a>, I believe I’m able to find the things that I really want to write about.</small></p>

<h6 id="quality">Quality</h6>

<p>Has my quality of writing improved?</p>

<p>Hard to say, but my gut feeling is no; two months probably isn’t long enough.</p>

<p>My <a href="/stranger-in-a-strange-land/">stranger in a strange land</a> post started as a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23543043">comment on hacker news</a>. People there seemed to really like what I wrote. I think my artistic language managed to tap into people’s own feelings and emotions (and probably nostalgia, given that almost nobody is travelling right now).</p>

<p>So I’d say that I can be pretty good at writing feelings-driven prose. The posts where I felt most passionate are certainly the ones that are most interesting to re-read, at least for me.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if I’m capable of that with my longer-form posts, as I get burned out quickly and I’m not sure that I’m maintaining my reader’s interest all the way through…</p>

In this state, there’s something on your mind and you can’t stop thinking about it or worrying about it. It’s worse when you can’t really... <a href="/micro/disturbed-productivity/">read more</a></p>
