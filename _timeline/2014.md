I taught myself Assembly so that I could develop the [Bartos Flur](/2015/03/10/bartos-flur/).
I completed my A Levels, achieving A\*A\*A, securing my place at Southampton University.
I moved to Southampton to study, and participated in the 
[HackaSoton Global Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/HackaSoton/photos/?tab=album&album_id=560395350759659).
