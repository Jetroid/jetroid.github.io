I finished my first year of university to a first-class standard. 
I worked as an intern at the university developing Puppet Modules during the summer.
I developed the [Polygraf](/polygraf/).
I worked with HackaSoton to
[run a Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/HackaSoton/photos/?tab=album&album_id=726820240783835),
and to help a group [learn to code](https://github.com/Jetroid/l2c).
