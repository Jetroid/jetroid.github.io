I [helped raise money](http://www.sfb.uk.com/mailers/eNews_July2012.htm#10)
for [Mary Ann Evans Hospice](http://www.maryannevans.org.uk/).
I graduated from Hartshill School and had first experience of programming - 
I wrote a simple CLI tool in Python to fix broken .vmf files
caused by a bug in Valve Software's map editor, Hammer.
