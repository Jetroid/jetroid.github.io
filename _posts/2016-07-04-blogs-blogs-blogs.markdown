It's 11:30PM on the 4th of July, 2016.
Today is a special date, not because of American Independance, but because today I finished writing an access portal for my blog!

Sporadically over the last month, I have been working on making a simulation of Fallout's terminal hacking.
I'm really new to HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and decided to dive in head-first into making a project.
I usually find that if I have a concrete goal I learn more trying to meet it, rather than having an abstract concept where "good enough" will do.

I finished my hacking simulator a few days ago, and was very pleased with the result.
I'm sure that my source code would make a more experienced web developer weep, but I'm a beginner in this particular aspect of design. Cut me some slack!

It was only when I had completed it that I realised I had no 'win condition'.
Making a lose condition was trivial - I could simply implement the 'Lockout' screen that the series has. 
Winning was a little harder. 
Hacking terminals in Fallout typically grants you the ability to read the various musings, communications and otherwise writings of the people of that world.
I could write a couple of fake entries, but then I had a lightbulb moment...!

I could use the logged-in portion of the terminal as my blog! 

Having a command-line type interface for my blog is not a new idea, per se.
My website was originally a really bad (read: barely functional) knock off of a terminal.

This older website was really clunky - it was my literally first foray into HTML - and whilst I was very proud of it at the time, it doesn't really meet my requirements.
I want to be able to...
