I'm going to be trying to write more to this website.

Usually, I try to aim for a certain standard of quality in my writing, and this can really hold me up from writing about something I want to write about.

Sometimes it takes a week _**or more**_ just to write _one_ post. Yeah, perfection is killer.

It gets worse when I add images, because I agonise over them.

So I'm going to be writing more things to a lower quality. I'm calling these 'Micro' posts, and you can find a full list here: [Micro](/micro/).

They will be just what I'm thinking about, or some small observations, or whatever. Generally without pictures, without proofreading, without rewording each sentence hundreds of times. Almost as if I have a typewriter and a stream of conciousness - no going back to make changes.

If you're struggling to understand the difference, compare the [Ctrl + Alt + Del](https://cad-comic.com/) webcomic with it's "Micro" webcomic, [Sillies](https://cad-comic.com/category/sillies/).

Because these posts will (probably) be of a lower quality to what I'd usually put out, I'm categorising them differently. Only the most recent few will show on the homepage (and also won't have images dedicated to them!).

At the end of each month, I'll publish a monthly summary that has links to all of the micro posts from that month, as well some writing at the top (like you're reading now!) that might include some reflections on the month. Or maybe I won't write anything there at all sometimes. Who knows?

I won't be sending out emails for every micro post either, though I will for the monthly summaries.

Micro posts and monthly summaries will not be considered as a '[latest](/latest/)' post. Instead, I have created a new url, for [latest micro posts](/latestmicro/). Hopefully that we be useful for people who like to bookmark things.

As always, everything I write (regular posts and also micro posts) will appear on the [archive](/archive/) page. Micro posts will appear in a smaller font.
