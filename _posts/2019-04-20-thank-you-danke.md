[Danke](https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/Restaurant_Review-g608496-d7908796-Reviews-Danke_Cafe-Tabanan_Bali.html) is a café [located in Tabanan](https://goo.gl/maps/fawb771Pv7g9VAKx8), Bali. I only went there on dates with Ni, my Balinese girlfriend, but I think it would be the perfect location for a digital nomad to work from.

Danke claims to have 100Mbps Wi-Fi speed, and there are multiple charging ports in reach of the tables by the walls (most of them).

I frequently see *bule* (foreigners) eating in Danke, so it's not exactly an overlooked place, but I only see Balinese working from here with Laptops. So I think it has been overlooked by the digital nomad community. Ni tells me that more and more *bule* are in Tabanan these days, so I suspect that Danke café will become a hot spot.

The food is cheap and delicious. Ni and I order enough food to satiste ourselves - several glasses of juice, food, dessert - and generally pay 100,000IDR (£5.50, €6.33, $7.10) or less for the two of us. They have vegan and vegetarian options.

They also have free snacks - Indonesian crackers, and crisps made from Cassava.

And board games too! Uno, Uno Jenga (I have no idea how the Uno part of this is meant to work), Angry-Birds themed Monopoly, and a chess board.

The only thing I don't like about Danke café is that smoking is allowed there. I find smoking to be a disgusting habit, and I feel sick whenever I am in the vicinity of it. I have a really bad reaction to it and generally feel the need to extricate myself from the situation.
