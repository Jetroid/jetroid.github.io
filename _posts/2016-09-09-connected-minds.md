Something crazy happened today.

I was walking home, minding my own business, 
watching the beautiful colours in the sky.
They were striking and vivid. 

I took a picture, thought little of it, 
and shared it on Facebook when I got home.

My sister replied shortly after with her own picture,
which I appreciated and commented on how the composition was near identical.

It was only afterwards that I thought about how unusual it was that
we took nearly-identical pictures at the same time frame as each other.

It turns out that I took my photograph at 19:49, and she took hers at 19:54. 

If you examine them closely, you can notice the same clouds in both images.
I think that it's crazy that this happened,
and I can't help wondering if other pictures were taken at the same time.

**Update:**

Crazier still, she sent me a second photo that she took,
which has even more similarities.

Even the position of the lamp post is the same!
