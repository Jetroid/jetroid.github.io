summary: "The story of the development of Polygraf, which went through many iterations and required several new skills."

My Father runs a small business called Frequency Central which
designs, builds and sells synthesiser modules.
The Polygraf is one such module.

The Polygraf has had several names and forms. 
The story behind how the Polygraf came about is quite a humorous one.
After having completed the Bartos Flur,
I was looking at some existing modules for
inspiration to build a new project for fun and for the experience.
I decided to attempt to replicate my interpretation of what a module *might* do.
I had no idea what the module actually did - 
I never touched it, played with it, nor analysed its functions. 
I simply looked at the front panel, and not particularly hard either.

To put it simply: 
As I know nothing about musical tech,
the module I looked at did not do at all what I thought it did.
The module was a sequencer running a pre-defined sequence 
and you could use switches to determine whether a particular output was
on or off for the entire sequence.
The circuit I made, later dubbed the 'Grid Machine'
was much more like a drum machine: 
You could program in 8 output, 16 stage sequences, which the module will remember in EEPROM.
The Grid Machine was able to support 15 user defined sequences 
plus one hard-coded-by-Frequency-Central that cannot change.

The problem with the Grid Machine was that the interface was not intuitive.
My Father commented that I had designed a device that only I knew how to use,
and that you would have to have a good understanding of binary to even
attempt to understand.
The project was discarded, despite being fully functional.

Spring 2015 brought many changes.
Frequency Central decided that there was merit to the idea - 
it just needed an improved interface. 
We decided to outfit it with two seven segment displays,
sacrificing 4 of the outputs.
This changes the functionality dramatically.
The interface would be much more usable,
whilst having only 4 outputs meant that now we
could store 32 sequences, 30 of which were user-programmable.

The plan for the module also changed. 
Rather than recording beats and outputting these through drum modules,
the four outputs would be connected to a 4514 4-to-16-line decoder.
Each of these 16 lines would then be connected to (variable?) resistors,
such that each line has its own voltage value. These voltages would then
be fed into a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) to produce sound.
As such, the module as a whole would be able to record sequences of
oscillations.

It was unclear if this extra circuit would be sold as an expansion module,
or if it would be sold built-in to the Polygraf. 
I wasn't too concerned about this extra circuit, 
as it did not require any additional programming -
the core PIC would remain the same. 
I had a certain level of fondness for the original idea as a drum-machine,
but Frequency Central thought strongly that the extra circuit
made a much more desirable product.

I worked on and off on the Polygraf (then known as the Event Horizon)
for a long time. I made significant progress during Summer 2015, 
but external factors such as my Degree and Internship prevented me from completing it.
I decided during my winter break 
(when I should probably have been revising for my exams!)
that I would complete the project before I went back to University.

My Father was amazed with the completed project. 
He loved how simple the seven segments made the module to use,
and he happily spent some time programming new sequences into it from artists he liked.
The plan is to ship the Polygraf with all sequences pre-programmed with beats from 
popular songs, as well as two generic beats called Motorik and Disco
(for the two hard-coded sequences).
To my delight, he even decided that the Polygraf was better as a stand-alone module,
rather than shipping with the additional circuit I described earlier.

Although the development prototype is fully functional,
we still need to decide on the pre-programmed sequences
and build a production-spec prototype. The project still has a way to go,
as the PCB needs to be designed before we can even think about selling it.
I'm really happy with how the project went, as it was collaboratively developed
and grew naturally from idea to idea.
