summary: "A look at how to get the most out of a simple concept."

My Father runs a small business called Frequency Central which
designs, builds and sells synthesiser modules.
Deep Thought is one such module.

Deep Thought started as a joke. 
My Father and I were talking about logic gates at a family dinner
when one of my family members mentioned that she didn't really understand.
I joked that I could program a PIC to create a box to demonstrate what each
logic gate does, and that she could take it in to teach the kids in her class
at the school she works at.

On the way to the train station after the meal, 
my Father and I talked about how it could actually be a useful module.
It would be very simple to program, and would not require a complicated circuit.
Designing the PCB should be quick, and the component cost would be low.
There was no real reason *not* to make it.

It really wasn't a complicated project, 
and I completed it within days of discussing it,
later fixing a few issues once a hardware prototype had been built. 

Of the three unreleased modules I have developed to date 
(Polygraf, Chronograf, Deep Thought), 
I would guess that this module releases first due to its simplicity.
As with these other two, it also needs a production prototype,
but this will really only change from the development prototype
from switches and LEDs to buffered sockets/buttons.
