QuaSH - Quantised Sample and Hold.<p> 
    &nbsp;Originally developed purely to add more subsystems to my A Level Electronics Project, the first iteration was designed to co-exist with the Bartos Flur. As such, I used the 8 channel ADC (Analogue to Digital Converter) to read each of the 8 inputs corresponding to the Bartos Flur outputs and then compare each to decide which channel of the Bartos Flur was active. (It made more sense to read the analogue inputs several times rather than waste components on a mixer.)<p>
  &nbsp;I realised pretty early on that I had a problem with applying the quantisation; To quantise, you want to have a total of 60 levels. As a PIC is binary, it is nicest to have 64 levels on 6 bits; hence, the upper 4 levels would be unused.<p>
  &nbsp;I decided to specify that the output of the QuaSH must go through a x(16/15) amplifier, and the input must go through a x(15/16) amplifier. This is an awkward solution requiring a lot of components but it helps to ensure that on a 0-5V system the proper quantisation occurs. Unfortunately, as Frequency Central does not buy perfectly matched resistor sets, the 'adjustment' will never be perfect, but it is a lot neater than the alternatives available from a programming perspective.<p>
  &nbsp;I knew right from the start that the 16F684 I was using for the project did not feature DAC (Digital to Analogue Converter) capability, but that it did feature PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) capability. PWM can be filtered to obtain (an approximation of) the real waveform again.<p>
  &nbsp;I had a few stumbles when attempting to output a PWM for the first time. My multimeter showed the output to just be a constant 5V for whatever I tried to output, and that indicated that something clearly wasn't working properly. It turned out that I was writing to the wrong part of the byte of the PWM module; I had configured it to output only 6 bits of the 10 bit maximum, but was writing  to the upper 6 bits, not the lower 6 bits. As such, 'obviously' it was outputting a full duty cycle for my input. After changing the write locations it worked.<p>
  &nbsp;The QuaSH needs changes before it can be utilised in an actual Frequency Central project. I need to remove the 8 channel reading and simply change it to read one input, and then I need to add an analogue input connected to a attenuator or socket so that various 'modes' can be selected.<p>
