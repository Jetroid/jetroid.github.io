		<div id="post-content"><p>Today, whilst trying to concentrate on an online lesson, I caught myself distracted. I was thinking about someone that I had disagreed with yesterday; and I wasn’t focussing because of it.</p>

<p>I always have troubles with focussing. So much so, that whilst writing the few lines up to this one, I have already been distracted by scrolling on my phone, fiddling with my tweezers, and playing with a set of nail clippers. Perhaps I have some kind of undiagnosed problem, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have trouble focussing. If there’s something particular that is bothering me - some kind of lingering thought or doubt - then that can really throw me off and disrupt me.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, I find it useful to stop what I am doing and address the problem. That might be to send a quick message and complete a quick task, or to just pause and let the thought run it’s course, or to actively dismiss the thought.</p>

<p>Of those, dismissing the thought is probably the least disruptive but also the hardest to achieve. I’m not very good at it, but I think that it is something that could be improved by meditating; when I meditate - and thus am trying to blank my mind - I often find myself chasing, catching, and playing with stray thoughts.</p>

<p>Today’s thought - the one that I mentioned at the top of this post - was about somebody that I had disagreed with online. When I caught myself thinking about her, I realised that she was <a href="https://patwalls.com/rent-free">living rent free in my mind, and thought back to this post by my friend Pat</a>.</p>

<p>It didn’t matter about who had the stronger argument; she was winning! She was taking my brain away from my own thought and self improvement because I couldn’t stop thinking about her.</p>

<p>Once I realised that, it was easy to stop my brain from thinking about her, and I went on to complete my online lesson.</p>
